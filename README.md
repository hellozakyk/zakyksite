# Hi, I’m ZakyK👋

→ **Graphic Designer & Frontend Developer | Crafting Visuals That Work Beautifully on the Web** ←

I combine **a designer’s eye for aesthetics** with **a developer’s mind for structure**, creating visuals and interfaces that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and technically sound.  I’ve been working as a **freelancer on Upwork for over 3+ years (100% JSS)** — helping brands and businesses shape their identity through strong visuals and seamless digital experiences.
